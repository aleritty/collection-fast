# Collection Fast

> Give me a collection, fast!!!

Generate a collection with *methods*, flexible *publications*, *forms* and *paginated lists*, for people that have no time to loose.

Under the hood everything is done following the [Meteor guide](https://guide.meteor.com/). Look at the source code, isn't it familiar?

Documentation is in [README.md](https://github.com/hotello/collection-fast/blob/master/packages/collection-fast/README.md) inside the package.

A little demo is provided if you clone the repository.
