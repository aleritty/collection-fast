# Collection Fast

> Give me a collection, fast!!!

Generate a collection with *methods*, flexible *publications*, *forms* and *smart components*, for people that have no time to loose.

Under the hood everything is done following the [Meteor guide](https://guide.meteor.com/). Look at the source code, isn't it familiar?

Read the docs [here](https://github.com/hotello/collection-fast/blob/master/packages/collection-fast/README.md).

To see it in action have a look to [gyroscope](https://github.com/hotello/gyroscope/tree/master/packages/gyroscope) package.

A little demo is provided if you clone the repository.
